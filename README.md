A powerful, general-purpose Python utility to batch download images from any URL pattern, resize them, and apply uniform padding/centering. Perfect for creating standardized assets for dashboards, games, or UI projects.

## Features

- **🎨 Smart Auto-Padding**: Automatically resizes images to fit within a specific bounding box while maintaining aspect ratio, then centers them on a unified canvas.
- **🚀 Batch Processing**: Download hundreds of images in seconds.
- **🔧 Universal Config**: capable of grabbing tech logos, game sprites, country flags, or any web asset with a predictable URL structure.
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Skips broken links gracefully without crashing.

## Quick Start

1.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Script**:

    ```bash
    python downloader.py
    ```

3.  **Check Output**:
    Images will appear in the `downloaded_assets` folder (or whatever you configured).

## Configuration Guide

Open `universal_downloader.py` and edit the **USER CONFIGURATION SECTION** at the top.

### Scenario A: Downloading Tech Logos

Use the Dashboard Icons CDN (default).

```python
URL_PATTERN = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/png/{name}.png"
ITEMS_TO_DOWNLOAD = ["ubuntu-linux", "python", "docker", "react"]
```

### Scenario B: Downloading Pokemon Sprites

Use the PokeAPI repository.

```python
# Note: PokeAPI uses IDs or Names. '1' is Bulbasaur.
URL_PATTERN = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/{name}.png"
ITEMS_TO_DOWNLOAD = ["1", "4", "7", "25", "150"] # Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu, Mewtwo
```

### Scenario C: Downloading Country Flags

Use FlagCDN (uses 2-letter ISO codes).

```python
URL_PATTERN = "https://flagcdn.com/w320/{name}.png"
ITEMS_TO_DOWNLOAD = ["us", "gb", "fr", "jp", "de"]
```

## Customizing Dimensions

You can control the output look by adjusting these variables:

- `CANVAS_SIZE`: The total size of the final image (e.g., 350x350).
- `IMAGE_MAX_SIZE`: The max size of the logo/sprite itself (e.g., 250x250).
- `PADDING_COLOR`: Background color (default is transparent).
